      "pos: 0.00, neu: 0.84, neg: 0.16, compound: -0.75  Vipassana is a technique and practice to “know thyself.” Understanding the inner nature as a way to understand…everything. It was rediscovered by Gautama the Buddha 2,500 years ago through rigorous scientific self-experimentation to answer the question: how do I stop suffering?\n",
      "pos: 0.14, neu: 0.72, neg: 0.13, compound:  0.20  Vipassana’s singular objective is to hack the deepest layer of the mind and reprogram it: instead of unconsciously reacting to feelings of pain or pleasure, consciously observe that all pain and pleasure aren’t permanent, and will ultimately pass and dissolve away.\n",

One’s natural reaction is to change posture to avoid the pain. What if, instead of moving, one observed the pain and decided to remain still through it?\n",

He wanted to end his attachment to craving (of pleasure) and aversion (of pain) by experiencing it directly. His theory was ending attachment ends his misery.\n",
      "pos: 0.13, neu: 0.77, neg: 0.09, compound:  0.31  Meditation is often thought of as calming, relaxing, and a detox of all the noise in the world. That’s not vipassana.

      "pos: 0.23, neu: 0.64, neg: 0.14, compound:  0.70  Vipassana would likely be good for those suffering chronic pain to help manage it.

Believe the #1 thing we should focus on is someone’s physical safety first. That one statement leads to a lot of ramifications. #Karajack\n",
      "pos: 0.14, neu: 0.55, neg: 0.31, compound: -0.92  Myself? C. We’ve made progress, but it has been scattered and not felt enough. Changing the experience hasn’t been meaningful enough. And we’ve put most of the burden on the victims of abuse (that’s a huge fail). #Karajack\n",
      "pos: 0.17, neu: 0.73, neg: 0.10, compound:  0.46  Putting the burden on victims? Yes. It’s recognizing that we have to be proactive in enforcement and promotion of healthy conversation. This is our first priority in #health. We have to change a lot of the fundamentals of product to fix.\n",
      "pos: 0.12, neu: 0.70, neg: 0.18, compound: -0.61  Agree it matters a lot. And it’s the most important thing we need to address and fix. I’m stating that it’s a fail of ours to put the majority of burden on victims. That’s how the service works today. #Karajack\n",
      "pos: 0.12, neu: 0.80, neg: 0.08, compound:  0.18  First and foremost we’re looking at ways to proactively enforce and promote health. So that reporting/blocking is a last resort. Problem we’re trying to solve is taking that work away. #Karajack\n",

      "pos: 0.10, neu: 0.79, neg: 0.11, compound: -0.30  This is exactly the balance we have to think deeply about. But in doing so, we have to look at how the product works.

      "pos: 0.22, neu: 0.72, neg: 0.06, compound:  0.75  Good question. This is why we’re focused on understanding what conversational health means.

      "pos: 0.15, neu: 0.61, neg: 0.24, compound: -0.39  I mean off platform, offline ramifications. What people do offline with what they see online. Doxxing is a good example which threatens physical safety. So does coordinate harassment campaigns. #Karajack\n",
      "pos: 0.00, neu: 0.91, neg: 0.10, compound: -0.22  Within the service? Likely within replies. That’s why we’ve been more aggressive about proactively downranking behind interstitials, for example.\n",
      "pos: 0.19, neu: 0.81, neg: 0.00, compound:  0.81  No, not a police force.

      "pos: 0.06, neu: 0.94, neg: 0.00, compound:  0.33  I see the link, and that’s why we need to put physical safety above all else. That’s what we’re figuring out how to do now.

      "pos: 0.10, neu: 0.86, neg: 0.05, compound:  0.25  It’s the reality. We tried to do too much at once and were not focused on what matters most. That contributes to slowness. As does our technology stack and how quickly we can ship things. That’s improved a lot recently #karajack\n",

      "pos: 0.06, neu: 0.90, neg: 0.05, compound:  0.10  We have to enforce based on our policy and what people do on our service. And evolve it with the current times. No way I can answer that based on people. Has to be focused on patterns of how people use the technology. #karajack\n",

      "pos: 0.22, neu: 0.74, neg: 0.04, compound:  0.84  We should expect a lot more coordination between governments and platforms to address. That would give me confidence.

Expecting mainstream customers to validate details on a small display is *unlikely* to increase security and *likely* to reduce device reliability, increase device cost, and decrease accessibility. Is the product better if a display isn't required?\n",
      "pos: 0.20, neu: 0.70, neg: 0.11, compound:  0.51  8/Today’s recovery mechanisms burn money. Customers have to protect recovery information from damage, loss, and theft and store secret(s). In practice, this is not yet mainstream-ready. We don’t want more passwords on post-its. What best of class solutions should we consider?\n",

A smooth experience likely depends on a custom-built app but it doesn’t need to be owned by Square. We can imagine apps that work without Square and maybe also without permission from Apple and Google. You?\n",
      "pos: 0.14, neu: 0.63, neg: 0.23, compound: -0.53  5/Mobile devices are a huge liability. An always-in-your-pocket device will never be safe enough to be solely responsible for your bitcoin. Whether through accidental loss, theft, or in worst cases coercion, having some friction here is beneficial. What’s the right friction?\n",
